# IntegrateSpectra
Backstory:
This project come up due to the data that were obtained from the streak camera was large, and i need to integrate it
his R script would integrate your Spectra provides the 1st column is wavelength and the rest is the intensity for any number of columns
this script would work if you have delayed time file containing: 1st column as the delayed time and 2nd column as the collection durations
This script may produce figures plotted as linear-logarithmic also logarithmic-logarithmic and a csv file
ENJOY!
